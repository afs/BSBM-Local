==== Build Setup 

mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=lib-sys


# -sync can delete as well
ivy -settings ivysettings.xml -ivy ivy.xml \
    -retrieve 'lib-sys/[artifact]-[revision](-[classifier]).[ext]' \
    -sync retrieve

==== Process

See run-complete for a script to drive all the scripts.

mkdir Data
mkdir TDB-DB
mkdir Sesame-DB

genAll      (choose sizes wanted)
SIZES="50k 250k" loadAll     (choose sizes to load)
SIZES="50k 250k" runPerf     (choose sizes to test)
runResults

Also:

DATE=[date 2010-MM-DD]
mkdir Runs/$DATE
mv Results/* Runs/$DATE

# Note: the Java code knows the range of possible store sizes
# If you miss 200m out, say, you get
# "Error: XML result file names must contain size metrics e.g. store_50k.xml for res-200m.xml"

# Run results and create bsbm-results.html in the Runs/DATE/ directories:
genAllResults



== Layout:

Data/data-SIZE/...files...
Results/res....

genAll creates all the datafiles laid out like this.


== BSBM details

The original benchmark uses the web API and ...
# Execute single-client test run (500 mixes performance measurement, randomizer seed: 808080)
# Execute multiple-client test runs. ( 4 clients, 500 query mixes, randomizer seed: 863528)
# Execute test run with reduced query mix. (repeat steps 2 to 4 with reduced query mix and different randomizer seed 919191)

== Commands
benchmark.generator.Generator
benchmark.testdriver.TestDriver
benchmark.tools.ResultTransform


== Generate

== Run Generator

50k:  128
250k: 666
5m:   14088

200M:   570000


java -cp bin:lib/ssj.jar benchmark.generator.Generator -fc -pc 1000 -s ttl

-s <output format>  	

For the dataset there are several output formats supported. See upper table
for details. Default: nt

-pc <number of products>  	

Scale factor: The dataset is scaled via the number of products. For
example: 91 products make about 50K triples. Default: 100

-fc  	

The data generator by default adds rdf:type statements for all types of a
product to the dataset. If the SUT supports RDFS reasoning, the option -fc
can be used to exclude these statements and leave generating them to the
inference engine of the store. Default: disabled

-dir 	

The output directory for all the data the Test Driver uses for its
runs. Default: "td_data"

-fn 	

The file name for the generated dataset (suffix is added according to the
output format). Default: "dataset"

--------------------
== Run tests
java -cp bin:lib/* benchmark.testdriver.TestDriver http://localhost/sparql


-runs <number of runs>  	

The number of query mix runs. Default: 50

 -idir <directory> 	

The input parameter directory which was created by the Data
Generator. Default: "td_data"

 -w <number of warm up runs> 	

Number of runs executed before the actual test to warm up the
store. Default: 10

-o <result XML file>  	

The output file containing the aggregated result overview. Default:
"benchmark_result.xml"

-dg <default graph URI>  	

Specify a default graph for the queries. Default: null

-mt <number of clients> 	

Benchmark with multiple concurrent clients.

-seed <Long value> 	

Set the seed for the random number generator used for the parameter
generation.

-t <Timeout in ms> 	

If for a specific query the complete result is not read after the specified
timeout, the client disconnects and reports a timeout to the Test
Driver. This is also the maximum runtime a query can contribute to the
metrics.

-q 

Turn on qualification mode. For more information, see the qualification chapter.

-qf <qualification file name> 	

Change the qualification file name, also see the qualification chapter.
